Working Steps of LLM-Network: Peer-to-Peer Language Model Sharing System

1. Network Initialization and Peer Discovery
   a. System startup:
      - Node initializes UDP module on port 5000
      - Automatic detection of network interfaces
      - Preparation of TCP listeners for peer connections
   
   b. Peer Discovery Process:
      - Broadcast UDP discovery messages across the network
      - Listen for responses from other peers
      - Maintain active peer list with 60-second timeout mechanism
      - Exchange LLM capability information

2. Resource Management and LLM Integration
   a. Local Resource Setup:
      - Initialize connection with local Ollama instance
      - Register available language models
      - Configure resource allocation limits
   
   b. Capability Broadcasting:
      - Announce available LLM models to network
      - Share resource capacity information
      - Update peer capability registry
      - Monitor resource availability

3. Communication and Data Flow
   a. Establishing Connections:
      - TCP connection initialization between peers
      - Handshake protocol execution
      - Session establishment
   
   b. Message Handling:
      - Process incoming requests
      - Queue management for LLM tasks
      - Load distribution across available peers
      - Response routing and delivery

4. Conversation Management
   a. Local Processing:
      - Create and manage conversation sessions
      - Store chat history locally
      - Handle user input/output
   
   b. Synchronization:
      - Real-time conversation updates across peers
      - State synchronization between nodes
      - Conflict resolution mechanisms

5. User Interface Interaction
   a. Web Interface Operations:
      - Display real-time chat interface
      - Show peer status and availability
      - Present LLM model options
      - Handle user inputs and commands

6. Data Persistence and Recovery
   a. Storage Management:
      - Save conversation history
      - Cache peer information
      - Store system configurations
   
   b. Recovery Procedures:
      - Handle peer disconnections
      - Implement fallback mechanisms
      - Restore conversation states
      - Reconnect to network

7. System Monitoring and Maintenance
   a. Health Checks:
      - Monitor peer connectivity
      - Track resource usage
      - Verify LLM availability
      - Check system performance

   b. Maintenance Tasks:
      - Clean up expired sessions
      - Update peer registry
      - Optimize resource allocation
      - Manage system logs

This peer-to-peer system creates a robust, decentralized network for sharing LLM capabilities across multiple nodes, enabling efficient resource utilization and real-time collaboration while maintaining system reliability and data persistence.
